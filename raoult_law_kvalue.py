    # INPUTS:
    #
    #  T - temperature (units of K)
    #
    #  P - pressure (units of bar)
    #
    #  a - Antoine equation coefficients with coefficients for each species in
    #      a row. When drawing Antoine coefficients from NIST, these will expect T
    #      and p in units of K and bar. Antoine coefficients from other sources 
    #      will require compatible units.
    #
    #  gamma - OPTIONAL activity coefficients for use in a modified Raoult's law.

    # OUTPUT:
    #
    #  K - row vector containing the K-value for each species
