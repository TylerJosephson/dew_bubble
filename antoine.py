    # Uses Antoine's equation to obtain the vapor pressure of a substance given
    # the coefficients of the equation:
    #  Ps = a1 - a2/(a3+T)
    #
    # INPUTS:
    #  a - the antoine coefficients with coeffients in columns and species in
    #      rows. Coefficients from NIST expect units of bar and K.
    #  T - the temperature at which the vapor pressure is evaluated (K)
    #  tempUnit - OPTIONAL the unit of temperature used
    #
    # OUTPUT:
    #  Ps - row vector of species vapor pressures at the specified temperature,
    #       typically in bar.
    #
    # The units depend on the units used for the coefficients. The user is
    # responsible for maintaining consistency with units. NIST uses bar and K.
