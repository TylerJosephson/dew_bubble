# VLE calculations using Antoine's Equation and Raoult's Law

#### These files demonstrate the calculation of a T-x-y diagram for ideal mixtures in equilibrium with an ideal vapor, whose vapor pressure follows the empirical correlation of Antoine's Equation.

#### We grab Antoine's coefficients from the NIST webbook using requests and BeautifulSoup. We also use numpy and matplotlib.
